    <h1>Health Insurance Price Prediction Based on Demographic and Lifestyle Factors</h1>

    <h2>Abstract:</h2>
    <p>
      Health insurance is a vital aspect of healthcare planning, offering financial protection against the cost of medical treatments and services. Predicting health insurance prices accurately helps individuals and families make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage. This study focuses on building a predictive model for health insurance prices using demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
