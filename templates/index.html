    <h1>Health Insurance Price Prediction Based on Demographic and Lifestyle Factors</h1>

    <h2>Abstract:</h2>
    <p>
      Health insurance is a vital aspect of healthcare planning, offering financial protection against the cost of medical treatments and services. Predicting health insurance prices accurately helps individuals and families make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage. This study focuses on building a predictive model for health insurance prices using demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

      Health insurance pricing is influenced by a variety of factors that contribute to an individual's health risk and potential healthcare expenses. Analyzing these factors can provide insights into how insurance premiums are determined and help individuals understand what drives the cost of coverage. This study aims to develop a predictive model that uses key demographic and lifestyle variables to estimate health insurance prices.
